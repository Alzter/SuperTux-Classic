I love the autotiling feature.","I least enjoy the broken undo/redo feature and the editor resetting its position after testing a level.","An area of the editor I've never personally used is the particle editor, so I cannot comment on it.","I prefer the M2 editor because it isn't as buggy as the M1 one. M2 also has a support for many custom tilemaps, while SuperTux M1 supports only 3 preset tilemaps.","I prefer using the editor on PC because some areas of the editor are unusable on mobile (text input). Using the level editor on mobile is uncomfortable, too.","","","I would like to see a good, easy-to-use UI, undo/redo functionality, a good amount of ways to manage objects, as well as be able to script them.
