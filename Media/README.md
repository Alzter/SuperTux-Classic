# Media Directory

The media repository contains all the working files for the REMASTERED graphics, sounds, and music in SuperTux Classic.
This work builds off the original assets made for SuperTux by SuperTux team.

This repository does NOT contain working files for the ORIGINAL SuperTux assets (e.g. Tux, snowballs, etc).
It only contains working files for the improved or newly created graphics that are unique to SuperTux Classic.

You can find SuperTux's ORIGINAL working files here: https://github.com/SuperTux/media

# Opening these files

You will need specific applications to open these working files, depending on what type they are.

* Image / Art files (.xcf) - You will need GIMP to open these. They were created with GIMP 2.8.22 specifically.
* Tracked Music files (.it, .mod, .xm) - You will need OpenMPT to open these. Set "Resampling" to None in OpenMPT for authentic playback.
* Sound Effect files (.aup, .aup3) - You will need Audacity to open these.

# Naming protocol of files

Typically, newer versions of files are denoted by having a higher number at the end.

For example, "Snow3.xcf" would be the next iteration of "Snow2.xcf".
