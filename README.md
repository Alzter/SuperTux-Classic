## Creating your own content
Would you like to create your own levels for SuperTux Classic?
What about replacing the game's textures or sounds, or even creating custom enemy types or powerups?

If you would like to modify the game in any way, you'll need to open SuperTux Classic in the Godot Editor.

To do this, you'll first need to download SuperTux Classic's source code, either by cloning this repository or by downloading it as a .ZIP.

Next, you'll need to download the latest version of Godot from [their website](https://godotengine.org/).

Once you have both SuperTux Classic and Godot downloaded, open Godot and add SuperTux Classic into your project list. You can do this in Godot by clicking "Scan", and then navigating to the folder where you downloaded SuperTux Classic.
